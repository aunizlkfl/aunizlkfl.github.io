## 📌 Challenge Info
- **Category:** Web Exploitation
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Event:** picoCTF 2025

**Description:**  
Cookie Monster has hidden his top-secret recipe inside his website 🍪. Our mission? Outsmart Cookie Monster and uncover the hidden cookie flag!

---

## 🛠️ Steps to Solve

### 1️⃣ Intercept the Login Request
At the login page, input any credentials (for example: `admin:admin`).  
Before hitting enter:
- Open **Burp Suite**
- Enable **Proxy Intercept**
- Make sure **FoxyProxy** in enabled in your browser.

---

### 2️⃣ Send Request to Repeater
Once Burp Suite captures the request:
- Send it to **Repeater** (`CTRL + R`).
- Resend the request.
- Check the **Set-Cookie** header → you will find something interesting:

```
Set-Cookie: secret_recipe=cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzX0M0MzBBRTIwfQ%3D%3D
```

✨ Highlight the encoded text!

### 3️⃣ Decode the Cookie
Open **Inspector** in Burp Suite. The value is encoded twice:
1. First: **URL Encoding → Base64**
2. After decoding, you’ll get the flag 🎉

## 🔎 Explanation of the Vulnerability
The challenge relies on **insecure cookie storage**. Instead of protecting the recipe, the server simply encodes it (URL + Base64). Encoding only hides the data, but anyone with access to the cookie can decode it easily. This is a common mistake in web applications where developers confuse encoding with encryption.

---

## 📝 Lesson Learned
- **Encoding ≠ Security.** Encoded data can always be decoded back.
- Sensitive data should never be stored client-side in plain or encoded form.
- Use proper encryption and server-side validation to protect secrets.
